# Multi-Agent Swarm

Agent Swarm is an AI agent architecture in which a collection of individual AI agents would work together through collaboration.

Unlike the Agent Supervisor architecutre which a supervisor agent would delegate tasks to the other agents, each agent in the Agent Swarm are made aware of the presence of each other and would hand over control depending on the context of the user's inputs and the specialties of each agent.

In the below example, depending on whether the user's question is related to English, Mathematics or History, each agent would transfer control to the corresponding specialised agent to provide the answer.
